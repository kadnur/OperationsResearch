## HUB Location Network Optimization Problem

***
This repository contains the implementation of 2 solution approaches to the HUB Location Network Optimization Problem.

* A Mixed Integer Linear Programming solution.
* A metaheuristic solution consisting of the implementation of an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm. 

Both of the solutions are implented in their respective Jupyter Notebooks located in the root folder of the repository. They are configured to import their corresponding datasets given the relative paths of the cloned repository, so running all the cells in the preferred notebook platform is enough to find the each of the solutions (using default tunable parameters).

Furthermore, a scientific report describing with detail the nature of the particular problem and explaining the rationales of both solutions can be found in the Documentation problem under the name "*Report_HubLocationNetworkOptimization.pdf*".
